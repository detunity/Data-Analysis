Students Performance in Exams - Excercise Version
Context
This data set includes scores from three exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them.

Inspiration behind this project:
To understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance.

Summary
The main aim of this notebook is to analyse how are the scores impacted based on different variables which include gender, race, lunch, test preparation course etc...

Each column is picked and analysed how they affect the scores.

For easy understanding we'll be using graphs and plots because visualisation is the best way to understand.
